# About the Project
This is a playable game of connect four. The final version will include a GUI and one or more opponents. Inspiration is taken from the AlphaGo project which utilized a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to play Go.

# Usage
**v0.1.0-alpha**  
A compiled .jar file can be found on the releases page along with zipped source code.
In the terminal type  
```
java -jar ConnectFour.jar <mode>
```
where `<mode>` is either "easy" or "ai". Any other arguement will default to a human opponent (user input for both players).
